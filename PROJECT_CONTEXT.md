## Project Name

Maintenance Wizard AI

## Hackathon

Tata Steel AI Hackathon 2026
Round 2 - Agentic AI Challenge

**Developer:** Likhith Sai Parepalli

---

## Project Vision

Build an enterprise-grade Agentic AI maintenance assistant for steel manufacturing plants that helps maintenance engineers diagnose equipment failures, identify root causes, predict future breakdowns, assess operational risks, and generate actionable maintenance recommendations.

The system should behave like an intelligent maintenance engineer capable of reasoning over multiple information sources and providing explainable decisions.

---

## Problem Statement

Industrial maintenance teams deal with large volumes of:

* Equipment logs
* Sensor alerts
* Maintenance history
* SOP documents
* Equipment manuals
* Inspection reports

Finding the correct root cause and deciding the next maintenance action often requires significant manual effort.

The objective is to build an AI-powered decision-support platform that reduces downtime, improves maintenance planning, and increases operational efficiency.

## Primary Users

### Maintenance Engineer

Responsibilities:

* Diagnose equipment issues
* Investigate failures
* Plan maintenance actions

### Plant Supervisor

Responsibilities:

* Monitor equipment health
* Review risk assessments
* Approve maintenance actions

### Reliability Engineer

Responsibilities:

* Analyze recurring failures
* Improve maintenance strategy
* Reduce unplanned downtime

---

## Core Capabilities

### Equipment Diagnosis

The system should analyze:

* Error logs
* Sensor readings
* Historical incidents

Output:

* Probable root causes
* Supporting evidence
* Confidence score

---

### Predictive Maintenance

The system should:

* Detect anomalies
* Estimate failure probability
* Predict maintenance needs

Output:

* Predicted issue
* Risk level
* Suggested maintenance timeline

---

### Risk Assessment

The system should evaluate:

* Failure severity
* Operational impact
* Safety implications

Output:

* Risk score
* Priority ranking
* Criticality level

---

### Knowledge Retrieval

The system should search:

* Equipment manuals
* SOP documents
* Historical maintenance records

Output:

* Relevant sections
* Similar incidents
* Supporting documentation

---

### Maintenance Recommendations

The system should generate:

* Corrective actions
* Preventive actions
* Inspection checklists
* Spare-part recommendations

---

### Explainable AI

Every recommendation must include:

* Why the recommendation was made
* Data sources used
* Retrieved evidence
* Confidence level

No black-box decisions.
